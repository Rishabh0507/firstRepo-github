 			<h3>Corporate values</h3>
 			We at Sarvaswa Ventures believe in being firmly rooted to the ground hence humility is an innate part of the business. Being cliche is not for us. We want to be different and to achieve this uniqueness, our products and services need to leave a longstanding impact on our customers and thus our commitment to daze and amaze with finesse. ‘Curiosity is the mother of all inventions’ and what is a business without innovation?

			We staunchly second the fact that weird is great and so to prevent our team from dying of monotony we urge them to grow, learn and expand by being adventurous in the business and by taking risks. Lastly, the business was a result of great passion, grit and determination and we would like to keep this torch of unflinching loyalty burning.
